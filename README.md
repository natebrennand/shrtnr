#Shrtnr

A very basic Golang URL shortener backed by Redis.
Created as an exercise in learning Go.

Has a very basic frontend angular app included.
Great examples of how not to use Bootstrap.


##Dependencies

Tried to only use standard library as far as I could.
Since I wanted some persistance Redis seemed like appropriate rule bending.
